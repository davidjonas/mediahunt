MediaHunt
=========

This is some simple example code for the use of cartoDB for geolocating youtube videos.

It's just an html/javascript page that displays a map of your current location and nearby saved Carto DB points with a youtube id on the description.
Once you stand 20 meters from a point, the video plays automatically.

Display is optimized for any type of screen be it tablets, phones or computers.


Configuring
===========

* Create a cartoDB account;
* Create a new table of points;
* Add points with the youtube id as description;
* Configure your settings on js/MediaHunt.js;
* Point a geolocation aware browser to the index page;
* Go out and find your points;
